# RescueRadar

**Description**: 

RescueRadar is a groundbreaking tracking system meticulously designed for underground mines. It aims to revolutionize mine safety and rescue operations by providing real-time tracking and distress signal capabilities.

**Features**:
- **Real-time Tracking**: The system provides precise location data of mine workers in real-time, enhancing their safety and facilitating swift response during emergencies.
- **Panic Button Integration**: Each tracking device is equipped with a panic button feature, allowing miners to send distress signals immediately in case of emergencies such as cave-ins, gas leaks, or injuries.
- **Seamless Connectivity**: RescueRadar establishes a seamless connection between tracking devices and access points underground, ensuring reliable communication even in challenging environments.
- **Swift Rescue Operations**: By reducing response time during emergencies, RescueRadar enables rescue teams to locate and extract miners quickly and efficiently, potentially saving lives.

**Technology Stack**:
- **Electron JS**: Built for Windows OS, RescueRadar utilizes Electron JS for its cross-platform capabilities, enabling compatibility with various devices commonly used in mining operations.
- **Socket.IO**: The system employs Socket.IO for real-time communication, enabling instant updates and alerts between tracking devices and central monitoring stations.
- **React**: The frontend interface is built using React, providing a user-friendly experience for miners and rescue teams alike.
- **Express**: The backend server is powered by Express, handling data transmission, authentication, and other backend functionalities.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VM**: RescueRadar is hosted on a GCP virtual machine, showcasing the team's expertise in cloud infrastructure management and deployment. Leveraging GCP's robust infrastructure, the team ensures scalability, reliability, and security for the application.

**Impact**: RescueRadar has the potential to significantly improve safety standards in underground mining operations. By providing real-time tracking and distress signal capabilities, it not only enhances the safety of miners but also enables more efficient rescue operations, ultimately reducing the risk of accidents and saving lives.
